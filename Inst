In this exercise, you are given (a part of) a data set from a clinical trial. You will need to use 3 types of prediction models and compare between.
The first model should be a linear classifier.
The second one should be an ensemble model.
The third should be a DL one.

Use the concepts we learn in class: train/validation/test split, grid-search, cross validation etc.
Notice, there is no need to implement the models, you can use scikit ones.

Your submission should be a jupyter notebook that has the next sections:
Loading the data (clean, transform if needed). Then train the three models. Finally, a comparison between the three: quantitative and qualitative (think what is the evaluation method you use).

You are encourage to share your performance on the forum, but please don't share the name of the algorithm you used, nor the parameters that were used.

The data has 30 features:
INTENSIVE - The clinical arm that was used (intensive or regular)
NEWSITEID - Site ID in which the participant was treated
RISK10YRS - Predicted risk for cardio vascular diseases
INCLUSIONFRS - Binary risk group
SBP - Systolic blood preassure
DBP - Diastolic blood preassure
N_AGENTS - Number of medications prescribed
NOAGENTS - Participants on no anti-hypertensive agents
smoke_3cat - Derived: Baseline smoking status
aspirin - BSL Hist: Daily Aspirin Use
egfr - Lab: eGFR MDRD (mL/min/1.73m^2)
screat - Lab: serum creatinine, mg/dL
sub_ckd - Derived: Subgroup with CKD (eGFR<60)
race_black - Incl/Excl: Black, African-American
age - Derived: Age at randomization top-coded at 90 years
female - Derived: Female gender
sub_cvd - Derived: subgroup with history of clinical/subclinical CVD
sub_clinicalcvd - Derived: subgroup with history of clinical CVD
sub_subclinicalcvd - Derived: subgroup with history of subclinical CVD
sub_senior - Derived: subgroup â‰¥75 years old at randomization
race4 - Derived: Four-level race variable (character)
CHR - Lab: Cholesterol, mg/dL
GLUR - Lab: Glucose, mg/dL
HDL - Lab: HDL-cholesterol direct, mg/dL
TRR - Lab: Triglycerides, mg/dL
UMALCR - Lab: mg Urine Alb / (g Creat * 0.01), mg/g Cr
BMI - Derived: body mass index (kg/m^2)
statin - Derived: on any statin
SBPTertile - Derived: Systolic BP tertile
EVENT_PRIMARY - Outcome (patient died or had a cardiovascular event)

Notice: You need to well explain why you choose the specific algorithms, configurations, or other decisions you made.
In the end, briefly summarize the method and details.
